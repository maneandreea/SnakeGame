# Snake Game

The Snake Game is a classic game written in JavaScript and utilizing HTML Canvas for rendering graphics. In this game, the player controls a snake that moves around a rectangular board, eating food and growing in length. The player must avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body, which causes the game to end. As the snake grows longer, the game becomes more challenging, requiring the player to plan ahead and avoid obstacles. The game features intuitive controls and smooth animation, making it a fun and engaging experience for players of all ages.
